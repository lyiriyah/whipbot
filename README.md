# whipbot
Bot used for mass DMing members in a specific role. Main purpose is for party whips to use in the political RP game Respublica.

## Usage
The config file needs to be created **before** you first run the bot. Use the example as a guide.
Make sure you have the `discord` package installed from pip.
It's untested on Windows. Should probably work.
Run it with `python main.py`. If on Linux, you can set it up to autorestart with a systemd/runit/openrc/whatever service.
